# Mystic Mayhem

Mystic Mayhem is a turn-based game between two players, where each player commands an army consisting of an Archer, a Knight, a Mage, a Healer, and a Mythical Creature. Players can create profiles, manage their armies, buy equipment, and engage in battles to earn gold coins and experience points.

## Game Features

- **Player Profiles**: Players create profiles with unique usernames and editable names. Each player has a unique userID and starts with 500 gold coins.
- **Army Management**: Players can buy characters from different categories (Archer, Knight, Mage, Healer, and Mythical Creature) and equip them with armor and artifacts.
